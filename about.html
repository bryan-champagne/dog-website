        <p>
          I'm a 9 year old black lab who's two favorite things are going for
          walkies and begging for food from my humans. I have my stuffed animal
          toys that I love to play with too, although I'm not too much of a fan
          of fetch.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I want something from my humans, I'll snort at them to let them
          know, and they usually get me what I want. I'm really good at giving
          side-eye, especially when I'm tired.
